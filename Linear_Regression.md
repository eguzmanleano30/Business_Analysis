## Linea regression Analysis of Customer Love for Sephora’s products 

### Research question 

Which factors influence the level of customer love for products sold on Sephora’s website? 

### Explanation of research question 

This research question investigates the factors contributing to the level of customer love for products available on Sephora’s website. The dependent variable, “love,” represents the number of people who love a particular product, indicating customer satisfaction and affinity towards the product. 

### Building a linear regression model for people who love products of Sephora beauty retail 

We will use a multiple linear regression model to examine what pushes customer love for Sephora's products. This approach allows us to assess how price, brand, marketing efforts, and customer reviews affect the love variable, which measures customer affection toward products. To analyze these variables together, the model will highlight the most significant influences of customer love, offering insights into practical strategies for enhancing product appeal on Sephora's platform. 

### Correlation Analysis: The log love variable in Sephora data 

Analyzing the log love correlations in the Sephora dataset highlights a few trends: 

-  **Strong Positive Correlation with log number of reviews:** A robust positive correlation (0.84) with log number of reviews indicates that products with more reviews are generally more loved, suggesting the importance of customer feedback in driving affection towards products. 

-  **Negative Correlation with Online Only:** The negative correlation (-0.38) with online-only suggests that products exclusively sold online are less loved, possibly reflecting a preference for in-store experiences. 

-  **Slight Negative Correlation with log price:** log love shows a slight negative correlation with both log_price (-0.18) and log_value_price (-0.20), indicating that higher-priced products may be less accessible or have higher expectations that are not always met. 

 -  **Positive Correlation with rating:** A moderate positive correlation (0.34) with rating suggests that better-rated products are more loved, highlighting the value of product quality and satisfaction.
