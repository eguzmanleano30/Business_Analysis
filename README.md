# Exploration Data Analsis of Sephora website

Sephora data incorporates varied variables, capturing product characteristics and customer interactions on Sephora's website. Categorical variables include product brand, category, size, marketing flags, and product details, while numerical variables comprise product ID, rating, number of reviews, customer affection (love), and price-related metrics. Before analysis, the dataset undergoes meticulous cleaning to handle missing values, rectify data errors, and ensure uniformity across categories. The variables irrelevant to our research questions will be eliminated to streamline the analysis.

-   **Informative Variables:** These include essential product details, such as their IDs, brands, names, sizes, URLs, available options (like colors and sizes), product details, usage instructions, ingredients, and marketing flags. 

-   **Binary Variables:** These variables indicate specific product attributes or conditions using binary values, such as whether the product is sold exclusively online, is exclusive to Sephora's website, is a limited-edition item, or has a limited-time offer (Binary variables are described in the second table of Appendix A). 

-   **Categorical Variables:** This category encompasses the types or categories to which products belong on the Sephora website, providing a structured way to organize and classify products (Categorical variables are described in the third table of Appendix A). 

-   **Numerical Variables:** These variables quantify different aspects of the products, including their ratings, the number of reviews they have received, the number of customers who have shown interest or "love" for the products, their prices, and their value prices (applicable for discounted products). We can get more details about numerical variables in the third table of Appendix A.
