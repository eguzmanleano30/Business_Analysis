## Justification for the Project:

The main objective of this project is to develop an understanding of the requirements of Sephora’s clients and analyze opportunities that can be exploited and weaknesses that can be avoided from online sales. 

The purpose is to demonstrate that the SWOT methodology could be a helpful tool for developing a business strategy from complex data that personal care and beauty retailers seek.  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before developing any business analysis, the Sephora website's data will be examined to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and gain insights through visualizations and summary statistics. Data transformation will ensure the data is clean and properly formatted, enabling accurate and meaningful analysis.

### Formulation of questions about the requirements of clients:

### Second research question 

Which factors influence the level of customer love for products sold on Sephora’s website?   

**Explanation of research question**
